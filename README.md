# COUN7ER - Eviction Strategies Countermeasure Database

Playbook-NG pulls entries from a database of post-compromise countermeasures and mitigations called COUN7ER. COUN7ER is a researched and curated collection of atomic actions that incident responders can take to contain and evict adversary agency within their networks and assets. As a Rosetta Stone of defensive measures, COUN7ER cross-references its countermeasures to many other frameworks, such as MITRE’s ATT&CK™, Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), and preventive best practice where applicable. The current COUN7ER catalog contains over 100 fully developed entries. 

The COUN7ER database is continuously reviewed and updated based on incident observations, threat intelligence, and any other source of information on threat actor tactics. Countermeasures undergo a rigorous review process to conform to written style, voice, and accuracy. CISA conducts internal tabletops to exercise countermeasures to examine potential challenges with implementation as well as effectiveness against adversary actions.
