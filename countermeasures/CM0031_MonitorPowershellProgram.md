## Intended Outcome

Monitoring PowerShell detects adversary execution using PowerShell.

## Introduction

PowerShell is one of the top post-exploitation techniques identified in
cyber incidents. Adversaries use PowerShell to carry out a wide-variety
of malicious tasks.

## Preparation

- PowerShell 5.0 requires at least Windows 7-SP1, Server 2008-R2-SP1, or later.
- PowerShell requires .NET Framework 4.5 or later.
- Determine which logging features should be turned on, based on the size of the resulting log files (to avoid issues with excessively large log files).

## Risks

- This countermeasure may result in excessive resource use.
- Module and Script Block Logging can create large log files.

## Guidance

The enhanced logging features of PowerShell 5.0 must be configured via Group Policy or registry keys. The following log types should be enabled:

- Enable module logging to capture command-line parameters and the content of pipeline output.  
- Enable script block logging to capture the commands inside PowerShell script blocks.  Includes encoded/obfuscated and decoded/deobfuscated code.  Does not capture command output.  
    - To avoid excessive logging, do not enable script block invocation start/stop events as it can result in an excessive number of events. 
- Enable transcription logging to capture records of every PowerShell session, including all input and output.  Transcription will log all commands, including base-64 encoded script blocks in memory. 
    - Consider recording timestamps.
    - Consider writing transcripts to a remote, write-only network share to ensure defenders are reviewing logs in secure manner.
