# Enable Active Directory (AD) Protected Users Security Group

* **ID:** CM0018
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Created:** 14 March 2025
* **Modified:** 14 March 2025
* **Type:** Enable
* **Status:** Active

## Intended Outcome

Enabling the Active Directory (AD) Protected Users security group
restricts adversary lateral movement using protected user credentials.

## Introduction

The Protected Users security group is designed as part of a strategy to
manage credential exposure within the enterprise. Members of this group
automatically have non-configurable protections applied to their
accounts. Membership in the Protected Users group is meant to be
restrictive and proactively secure by default. The only method to modify
these protections for an account is to remove the account from the
security group.

## Preparation

- Confirm that primary domain controller is running at least Windows Server 2012 R2.
- Confirm that client computers are running at least Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2.
- If systems to not meet above criteria, protected user group will not be available.

## Risks

- This countermeasure can break legitimate functionality.
- Adding Managed Service Accounts to "Protected Users" will break their functionality, by breaking Kerberos Constrained Delegation (KCD).
- Responders are advised against this countermeasure for this reason.

## Guidance

- Add “Admin” to the Protected Users Group
- Verify Protected User is Added
- Best Practices
    - The Protected Users Group protections may be replicated to OSes below Windows Server 2012 R2 if a Windows Server 2012 R2 or above is the Primary Domain Controller emulator.
    - The Protected Users Group protections will not work for client devices that are NOT Windows 8.1.
    - Maintain situational awareness on authentication attempts by reviewing “Protected Users” user and failure logs.
    - Never add all privileged accounts to the Protected Users Group since there is potential to be locked out.
