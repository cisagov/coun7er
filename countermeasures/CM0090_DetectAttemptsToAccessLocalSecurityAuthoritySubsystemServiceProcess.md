## Intended Outcome

Detecting attempts to access the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process detects adversary credential access via LSASS credential dumping.

## Introduction

Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) is a crucial system file on the Microsoft Windows operating system that is responsible for verifying users logging into a system, handling password changes, and creating access tokens. LSASS is frequently the target of adversarial efforts to dump credentials for the purposes of privilege escalation and lateral movement. 
  

## Preparation

No Preparation content identified. 

## Risks

No Risks content identified. 

## Guidance

Configure the host-based agent to detect:

-	Process lineage
    -    Instances where LSASS.exe was spawned from a suspicious parent process
    -    LSASS.exe as the parent of any process
-	Process access
    -    LSASS being accessed by a suspicious processes
    -    Filter out legitimate attempts to access LSASS (antivirus, policy enforcement, etc.)
-	File monitoring
    -    The creation of dump files in specific locations 
-	DLL module loads
    -    Commonly abused DLLs to dump LSASS
-	Command-line parameter inspection
    -    Functions used to dump LSASS
