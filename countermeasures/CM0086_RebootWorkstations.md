## Intended Outcome

Rebooting workstations removes memory-resident malware from Random Access Memory (RAM). 

## Introduction

Adversaries may deploy memory-resident malware to minimize their presence in a target network, circumvent defenses, and reduce the risk of being detected. Memory-resident malware exists in RAM and does not typically involve leaving artifacts on a host’s hard-drive.    

## Preparation

- Rebooting a workstation will destroy memory-resident malware and its artifacts. This can ultimately hinder further analysis. If this is a concern, consider capturing a memory dump before rebooting the host. 

## Risks

- Rebooting a workstation will clear memory-resident malware from RAM. If the malware has instantiated a persistence mechanism e.g. WMI event subscriptions, scheduled tasks, etc., the malware will persist after reboot. As such, rebooting workstations may not be adequate to completely mitigate the threat. 
- If a workstation is infected with ransomware, a reboot can result in permanent data loss.

## Guidance

-	Notify users and stakeholders in advance of any planned system reboots to minimize any potential disruptions or downtime. 
-	Consider capturing artifacts before the reboot for later analysis.
-	After the system has been rebooted, continually monitor the workstation for indications of persistence.
