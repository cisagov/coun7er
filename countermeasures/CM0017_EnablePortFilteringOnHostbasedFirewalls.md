# Enable Port Filtering on Host-based Firewalls

* **ID:** CM0017
* **Version:** 1.0

* **Type:** Enable
* **Status:** Active

## Intended Outcome

Enabling port filtering on host-based firewalls restricts adversary
lateral movement using subnet hosts.

## Introduction

Organizations may be able to provide sufficient security through a combination of endpoint detection and response (EDR) and network access control (NAC) solutions on endpoints. However, using host-based firewalls in combination with EDR and NAC provides layered defense.

## Preparation

- Organizations should manage their host-based firewalls with a centrally-managed service, such as Windows Group Policy Management Console (GPMC) or an alternate vendor-provided solution. 
- System administrators should consult internal policies and vendor instructions on how to appropriately configure their host-based firewalls and any other relevant NAC software.
- Host-based firewalls should be configured with a default deny rule, only allowing services and ports that are explicitly permitted.

## Risks

- This countermeasure can break legitimate functionality.
- Port filtering may block legitimate activity and break legitimate functionality.

## Guidance

### Windows

- To verify whether host-based firewalls are enabled by default on all hosts in a subnet, system administrators can launch GPMC and verify whether a Group Policy Object (GPO) exists that manages the firewall settings on all machines in the respective organizational unit.
- If host-based firewalls are not enabled by default on the affected subnet, organizations should identify the appropriate steps to isolate impacted systems from non-impacted systems and networks.

### Mac

- Each mobile device management (MDM) solution vendor may implement Mac firewall settings differently. Organizations that have introduced Macs into their environment should consult their vendorâ€™s documentation.
