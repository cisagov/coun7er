# Update Firmware

* **ID:** CM0066
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Created:** 14 March 2025
* **Modified:** 14 March 2025
* **Type:** Refresh
* **Status:** Active

## Intended Outcome

Updating firmware restricts adversary impact, privilege escalation, and lateral movement.

## Introduction

Updating firmware on a device (also called "flashing") overwrites existing firmware with new data to patch security vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and/or replace malicious firmware installed by an adversary. Flashing is essential when corrupted system or component firmware would persist with a reimage (e.g., when a rootkit has corrupted the firmware).

## Preparation

* Understand the potential impact of the update.
* Back up critical data.
* Have a plan for dealing with a corrupted or failed update.

## Risks

* Firmware is often stored in non-volatile memory, so if an update is corrupted or fails, the device may become unusable.
* Operations may be impacted because updating firmware requires system reboots and downtime.

## Guidance

Devices have different update methods, but the steps below apply to most.

* Identify the exact model and version of the device.
* Identify the update required and verify its integrity (firmware updates should come from the device manufacturer).
* Back up the current firmware version.
* Use an uninterruptible power supply (critical).
* Disable antivirus software (re-enable after the update).

Read the documentation provided by the device manufacturer for explicit firmware update steps. Common device access methods are outlined below. 

### Web Interface

If the device has a web interface, launch it and navigate to the firmware settings.

### Custom App or Tool

Some devices offer custom configuration tools. For example, Intel SSD drives use a custom tool called *Intel SSD Toolbox*. Using a custom tool typically involves navigating to the firmware update section and selecting "update."
