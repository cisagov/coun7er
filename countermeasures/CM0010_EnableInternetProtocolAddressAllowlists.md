## Guidance

On the host

- Check the firewall (Windows, UFW, etc.) for the presence of specific IP addresses for whitelisting.
- If not present, create an inbound rule for specifically approved IP addresses. 

On the Enterprise

- Maintain a list of allowed IP addresses.
- Import the allowlist into the endpoint detection/protection solution or via the main firewall.
- Process requests for adding new IP addresses to the allowlist.
