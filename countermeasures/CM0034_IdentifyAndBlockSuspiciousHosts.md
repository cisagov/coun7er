## Intended Outcome

Identifying and blocking suspicious hosts restricts adversary initial
access and privilege escalation from malicious hosts.

## Introduction

No Introduction content identified. 

## Preparation

- Take inventory of all hosts and services on the network.
- Establish a baseline of normal activity to more accurately detect suspicious and irregular events.
- Commercially solutions are available to identify and block suspicious hostnames. Determine which solution(s) will satisfy environmental requirements.

## Risks

- This countermeasure may have impacts that disrupt operations.
- The anomaly detection or intrusion prevention system may identify legitimate hosts as suspicious.

## Guidance

Identifying suspicious hostnames can be achieved through a combination of these tools and techniques:

- Network Monitoring Tools
    - Leverage network monitoring tools to identify suspicious hostnames by way of anomalous network activity or unauthorized connections. 
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) System
    - Use a SIEM to collect, aggregate, and analyze all available log data to identify suspicious hostnames and abnormal activity.  
- Host Discovery and Port Scanning
    - Use a host discovery or port scanning tool to take inventory of hosts and open ports.  Use this information to determine if a host and/or port is legitimate.
