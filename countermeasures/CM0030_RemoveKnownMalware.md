* **ID:** CM0030
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Created:** 14 March 2025
* **Modified:** 14 March 2025
* **Type:** Eliminate
* **Status:** Active

## Intended Outcome

Removing known malware terminates adversary collection, persistence, and
command and control using malware.

## Introduction

No Introduction content identified.

## Preparation

- Review malware eradication strategy to minimize chances of an adversary presence surviving or being reinstated after eradication steps have been implemented.
- Determine whether any specific vulnerabilities, if any, were used by or exploited to install the malware and investigate how to prevent future exploitation.

## Risks

- This countermeasure may have impacts that disrupt operations, including
    - Data loss: Data entered since the last clean backup may be lost.
    - Business disruption: Downtime during business hours may disrupt business.
- Errors can render this countermeasure ineffective.
- Confirm the integrity of any clean images/software prior to usage, to avoid the risk of re-infection.

## Guidance

The specifics on the eradication of malware, backdoors, and implants will vary with each instance. The following is a list of some recommended practices regarding malware eradication activities. Please note, this is not an exhaustive list.
- Search for Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) (IP addresses, domains, certificates).
- Search for Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) consistent with adversary activity.
- Exploit internal resources (threat intelligence feeds, logs, etc.) to inform understanding of the attack and pivot to discover additional IOCs and TTPs.
- Reimage affected systems by restoring to an original uncorrupted state.
- Rebuild or replace hardware in the event of hard to eradicate infections such as root kits.
- Replace compromised files with uncorrupted files.
- Install Patches to mitigate any existing vulnerabilities.
- Monitor the system to verify successful eradication.
