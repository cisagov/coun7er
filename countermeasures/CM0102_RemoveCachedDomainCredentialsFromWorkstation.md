## Intended Outcome

Removing cached domain credentials from workstations prevents adversaries from pursuing credential access via password stores and OS credential dumping. 

## Introduction

Caching domain credentials locally allows users to log-in if domain controller(s) are down. Adversaries abuse this functionality by dumping cached credentials using tools such as mimikatz.

## Preparation

- Identify which users, if any, should have credentials cached to maintain business operations or communications. 

## Risks

- Users won't be able to login if authentication servers are down and domain controller authentication is required. 
- Users won't be able to access networked resources. 

## Guidance

### Configure via Group Policy

Open gpedit.msc -> Computer Configuration -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> Security Options -> Double-click Policy Named, "Interactive logon: Number of previous logons to cache (in case domain controller is not available)." -> Select 0 
This will set previous cached credentials to zero. run gpuupdate force

### Configure via Registry

Open regedit.exe -> Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ -> Double-Click "cachedlogonscount" -> Set Value to 0. 
Restart will be required to enforce changes.
