#  Disable Hyper-V

* **ID:** CM0048
* **Version:** 1.0
* **Created:** 14 March 2025
* **Modified:** 14 March 2025
* **Type:** Disable
* **Status:** Active

## Intended Outcome 

Disabling the native Windows Hyper-V hypervisor blocks adversary privilege escalation, lateral movement, and potential C2 capability facilitated by hyperjacking and/or host escape techniques. 

## Introduction 

Hyper-V is a virtualization technology that allows users to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on Windows operating systems. Hyper-V (otherwise known as Viridian or Windows Server Virtualization) has personal and enterprise use cases across hardware virtualization. This countermeasure most closely remediates 'hyperjacking' attempts; hyperjacking involves an attacker installing malicious hypervisors or taking control of the hypervisor within a VM host.

Although there are procedures that reduce the risk of hyperjacking such as ensuring isolation of virtual machines behind firewalls and conducting patching of hypervisors, disabling the native Hyper-V hypervisor on Windows machines where it is unnecessary or underutilized most effectively prevents an adversaries' unauthorized control of virtual machines. 

## Preparation 

- Assess the enterprise network to determine system and service dependencies on Hyper-V. 
	- Type `msinfo32.exe` in Windows search box -> Select *System Information*
	- Locate entry `A hypervisor has been detected. Features required for Hyper-V will not be displayed.`
- Conduct backup of data on virtual machines managed by Hyper-V.
- Prior to disabling Hyper-V, ensure proper forensic information is collected on relevant virtual machines.
- Evaluate possible replacements to Hyper-V technology such as Citrix or Red Hat solutions.

## Risks 

- Disabling Hyper-V may disrupt services or the initialization of VMs altogether on host systems.
- Countermeasure may introduce compatibility issues with applications or services that rely on Hyper-V.
- Disabling Hyper-V may increase vulnerability of systems to downgrade attacks.

## Guidance 

### Disable Hyper-V via Control Panel

- Open the Windows **Control Panel** -> **Programs** -> **Programs and Features** -> *Turn Windows features on or off* 
	- Locate and expand the folder option titled *Hyper-V*.
	- Uncheck the *Hyper-V Hypervisor* check box.
	- Restart the computer to apply changes.

### Disable Hyper-V via PowerShell

- Open an administrator PowerShell terminal
	- Run the following command `Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor`
	- Restart the computer to apply changes.

### Disable Hyper-V via BIOS/UEFI

- Restart the computer to enter BIOS/UEFI settings
- Locate the **Configuration** tab.
- Locate the Virtualization Technology option (**Intel Virtual Technology**) to set to **Disabled**.
- Save changes and exit the BIOS/UEFI settings.

### Verify Hyper-V is Disabled

- Ensure that Hyper-V is disabled by executing the following PowerShell command in an elevated prompt:
	-  `Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V`
	- The returned **State** parameter should contain a value of '**Disabled**.
