# Reset NT Hashes for Smart Card-enabled Accounts

## Intended Outcome

Resetting NT hashes for smart card-enabled accounts restricts adversary
defense evasion and lateral movement using pass-the-hash attacks.

## Introduction

No Introduction content identified.

## Preparation

- Assess the potential disruption refreshing smartcards/personal identity verification cards will have on the organization prior.
- Verify that the adversary is inhibited from performing subsequent pass-the-hash attacks in the environment so that the adversary does not respond to this mitigation by simply dumping the hashes after a refresh is performed.
- Ensure that the action will not generate a large number of re-authentication requests that risk overloading the Domain Controllers.

## Risks

- This countermeasure may disrupt operations.
- Users of smartcard/PIV-enabled accounts will need to re-associate their smartcard with their account. This re-association can be disruptive if large numbers of users are affected. 
- Refreshing NT hashes will, by itself, not be sufficient to evict a adversary from a compromised network. An adversary must be fully evicted from a network for this countermeasure to be effective. Otherwise, a returning adversary with the requisite privileges may be able to engage in repeated credential theft of LM hashes.

## Guidance

### Automated Method 

- Consult the NSA’s Pass-the-Hash Guidance.
- Use either the NSA’s Invoke-SmartcardHashRefresh PowerShell cmdlet from the “PtHTools” module to change the underlying NT hash or the DoD PKI-PKE provided script under PKI and PKE Tools.

### Manual Method

- To manually update the NT hash for a specific account, disable and re-enable the “Smart Card required for interactive logon” (SCRIL) option.  
- The manual method is not scalable for large groups of accounts.
